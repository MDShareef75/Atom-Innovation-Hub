# ATOM Logo Installation Instructions

## 🖼️ Adding the Official ATOM Logo

To complete the rebranding to the official ATOM logo, please follow these steps:

### Step 1: Save the Logo Image
1. Save the ATOM logo image (the one you shared in the conversation) as `atom_logo.png`
2. Make sure it's in PNG format with transparent background for best results
3. Recommended size: 512x512 pixels or higher for crisp display

### Step 2: Place the Logo File
1. Navigate to your project folder: `atoms_innovation_hub`
2. Go to the `assets/images/` directory
3. Place the `atom_logo.png` file in this folder

### Step 3: Verify Installation
- The logo should appear in the app header (top navigation bar)
- The logo should appear in the welcome section hero area
- The logo should appear in the login screen
- The logo should appear in the about page
- The logo should appear in the copyright footer

### Current File Structure
Your assets folder should look like this:
```
assets/
├── images/
│   ├── ai-generated-9104187.jpg
│   └── atom_logo.png ← ADD THIS FILE
├── icons/
└── fonts/
```

### Fallback Behavior
If the logo file is not found, the app will gracefully fall back to:
- Text-based "ATOM" branding
- Icon placeholders
- The app will continue to work normally

The official ATOM logo is now used in:
- ✅ App header/navigation bar
